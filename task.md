## Key Issues Identified

1. **Race Conditions**: Multiple threads are accessing shared variables without proper synchronization
2. **Inconsistent Mutex Usage**: Different threads use different mutex locks to access the same data
3. **Death Flag Access Problems**: The monitor thread and philosopher threads are racing when checking/setting the death status

## Areas to Focus On

1. **Priority System for Odd Numbers of Philosophers**: When n%2 == 1, philosophers aren't getting proper fork priority
2. **Even-numbered Philosophers**: Need to think until their meal is ready at process start
3. **Mutex Protection**: All shared data needs consistent mutex protection

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Enhanced Priority System**:
   - Once a philosopher enters THINK state, give them highest priority to eat next
   - Implement a queue or priority flag for each philosopher

2. **Initial State Logic**:
   - Even-numbered philosophers should think at start until ready to eat
   - Odd-numbered philosophers with meal priority should eat immediately
   - No philosopher should sleep without eating first

3. **Fixed Synchronization**:
   - Use a consistent mutex for death flag access
   - Protect all shared state with appropriate mutexes
   - Fix the race condition in the monitor_routine and is_dead functions

4. **Fork Acquisition Strategy**:
   - Improve check_and_take_both_forks to respect the priority system
   - Ensure philosophers with priority can preempt others waiting for forks
